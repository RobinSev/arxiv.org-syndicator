# ArxivOrg Syndicator

## Context
This project has been realised in the second year of my computer science degree. We were in a group of 4.
We built it from scratch, using a formal bill of specifications.
We hadn't been taught the conception methods and patterns yet.

**Objective :** develop an application to harvest and syndicate scientific articles from the arxiv.org website, using its API. 
All the project was meant to put us in a situation as close as possible to a real project.
We used the agile scrum method, with a weekly meeting with our client/teacher to discuss the next steps and clarify the bill of
specifications (which was vague on purpose).

**My participation :** I was part of the team developing the model, and I personally handled the general architecture of it.
The only class I didn't work on is the Statistics class and its test.

## Evaluation criteria
We were evaluated on :

    * the overall quality of the code and the tests(readability, architecture, correctness).
    * the quality of the questions we asked the client to get closer to the expected outcome.
    * the project organization to fit the scrum method.
    * a personal report of our organization, its success and failures and the lessons we learned from it.
